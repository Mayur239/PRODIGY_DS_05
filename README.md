# Prodigy Infotech Internship Task 05

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of traffic accident records to uncover patterns and correlations between various factors such as weather, road conditions, time of day, and accident severity. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and safety agencies to mitigate traffic accidents and improve road safety.
## Dataset

The dataset includes the following variables:

* Temporal Factors: Time, Day_of_week
* Driver and Vehicle Details: Age_band_of_driver, Sex_of_driver, Type_of_vehicle,  Driving_experience, Service_year_of_vehicle
* Environmental Factors: Weather_conditions, Road_surface_conditions, Light_conditions, Area_accident_occured
* Accident Details: Accident_severity, Type_of_collision, Number_of_vehicles_involved, Number_of_casualties, Cause_of_accident
## Tools and Libraries:

* Jupyter notebook 
* pandas, numpy for data manipulation.
* matplotlib, seaborn for visualizations.
## Key Steps

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:

* Handle missing or inconsistent values.
* Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using encoding techniques.
* Standardize and aggregate variables to simplify analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Investigate the distribution of accidents across days, times, and locations.
* Examine the impact of road conditions, weather, and light on accident severity.
* Identify correlations between driver demographics and accident involvement.

3. Data Visualization:

* Temporal Analysis:
    * Line charts showing accident trends over time.
* Severity and Environmental Factors:
    * Cluster maps and heatmaps highlighting relationships between weather, road conditions, and accident severity.
* Area Analysis:
    * Pie and bar charts comparing accident rates in urban vs. rural areas.
* Casualty Patterns:
    * Visualizations of casualty demographics and severity by age and gender.


## Conclusion

This project provides meaningful insights into traffic accidents and contributes to understanding how to reduce their occurrence and impact. The repository serves as a resource for exploring data-driven road safety solutions.
